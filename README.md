This is the base install to my "Blog Site" currently running on GRAV CMS as its base and using the default "Quark" Theme, just modified slightly to have Dark Mode / Light Mode capabilities.

Also, this modification could not be possible without the work done by Louis Charette I simply took what he did and extracted the parts I needed. He gets all the credit.

I believe there is a theme called Typhoon that has this feature (and a lot more!) but it is not available without a fee ($50), since all I needed was just the "Dark Mode", I have implemented the solution from "Louis Charette" which is what is on this repository.

I tried to follow Louis steps from his blog, but I failed to implement his approach (I have zero knowledge of how Grav works and this made it difficult to understand his steps) and had to resort to trial and error until I got my results which I bring to you on this blog post, you are welcome to head over his blog and follow his steps.

I run this blog on a docker container hosted on Unraid OS and use the GRAV CMS image managed by Linuxserver.io those guys keep the images always up to date.
